    <h2>cranberry-sauce Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Fresh Cranberries:</strong> Opt for fresh cranberries that are firm, 
            plump, and blemish-free. Lighter colored cranberries are best for sauce, as they 
            contain more pectin and result in a thicker consistency.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Sugar: </strong>White sugar does more than add sweetness to classic cranberry 
            sauce: It also absorbs liquid and, when heated, thickens the sauce.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Orange Juice:</strong> All cranberry sauce starts with a liquid base. If you 
            don't like orange juice, you can substitute pomegranate juice or even red wine.</p></li>
    </ul>
